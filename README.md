# CREDIT-RISK-ANALYSIS
Credit Risk Analysis using Random Forest

# Project Overview

Credit risk analysis is a critical function in banking and financial services, aimed at evaluating a borrower’s ability to repay a loan.
This project uses the German Credit Dataset to build a machine learning–based credit risk classification system using a Random Forest model.

The objective is to classify loan applicants as Good Credit Risk or Bad Credit Risk by analyzing demographic, financial, and credit history attributes. The project demonstrates a complete end-to-end credit analytics workflow, aligned with real-world responsibilities of a Credit Analyst / Risk Analyst.
